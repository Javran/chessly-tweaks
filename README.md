Some of my random tweaks while playing around with Chessly

[Install latest](https://github.com/Javran/chessly-tweaks/raw/master/chessly.user.js)

## Features

For now just supporting some key presses in individual course sections / Drill Shuffle / Quiz Shuffle.

- Press `f` to "move forward" (click on "Try again" / "Submit" / "Next", whichever appears first).
- Press `r` to "move backward".

On "Drill Shuffle" / "Quiz Shuffle" configuration page, press `1` to inject 3 extra buttons:

- `Save`: saves current configuration.
- `Load`: loads previously saved configuration.
- `Load & Go`: load and click "Continue" button.
